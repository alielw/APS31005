# Introduction to the HPC

The aim of this practical is to get you started using the HPC.

## 1. Running jobs interactively

If you are on a worker node you will see the name of the node, eg.
```
[bo1nn@sharc-node004 ~]$
```

If not then request an interactive session:
```bash
qrsh
```

We can run small jobs on interactive sessions. You can configure the resources available to the interactive session by adding command line options. For example to start an interactive session with access to 16 GB of RAM:
```
bo1nn@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -l rmem=16G
```
or
To start a session with access to 2 cores:
```
bo1nn@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -pe smp 2
```
We will use the interactive session for ```plink```. We will cover this tomorrow.

Type
```
plink
```


## 2. Running batch jobs
