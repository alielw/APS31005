# Introduction to the HPC

The aim of this practical is to get you started using the HPC.

## 1. Running jobs interactively

If you are on a worker node you will see the name of the node, eg.
```
[bo1nn@sharc-node004 ~]$
```

If not then request an interactive session:
```bash
qrsh
```

We can run small jobs on interactive sessions. You can configure the resources available to the interactive session by adding command line options. For example to start an interactive session with access to 16 GB of RAM:
```
bo1nn@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -l rmem=16G
```
or
To start a session with access to 2 cores:
```
bo1nn@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -pe smp 2
```
We will use the interactive session for ```plink```. We will cover this tomorrow.

Type
```
plink
```


## 2. Running batch jobs

#!/bin/bash
#$ -l h_rt=2:00:00
#$ -l rmem=2G
#$ -m bea
#$ -e MD5.errorlog
#$ -o MD5.txt
#$ -M name@sheffield.ac.uk

Let's make a file called ```test.sh``` in your ```test``` folder.

Open it with ```nano```

The first line always needs to be ```#!/bin/bash```

You request time with ```#$ -l h_rt=00:00:00```

You request memory with ```#$ -l h_rt=0G```

You request nodes with ```#$ -pe smp 1```

The script will produce log output and error files
```#$ -e test.errorlog```
```#$ -o test.txt```

So the start of your ```.sh``` file should look like this:
```
#!/bin/bash
#$ -l h_rt=00:01:00
#$ -l h_rt=1G
#$ -pe smp 1
#$ -e test.errorlog
#$ -o test.txt
```

Then we want to tell the job to run it on our reserved nodes. These are only available from Wed onwards...
```
#$ -P aps31005
#$ -q aps31005.q
```

Then we specify the job we want to run
```
echo "Hello World"
```

Then we submit the job with
```
qsub test.sh
```

We can check the status of the job with ```qstat```

You should see something like this:
```
job-ID  prior   name       user         state submit/start at     queue                          slots ja-task-ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3528787 0.02478 QRLOGIN    bo1nn        r     02/16/2019 15:55:41 interactive.q@sharc-node003.sh     1
3528789 0.00003 test.sh bo1nn        qw     02/16/2019 15:58:35 all.q@sharc-node073.shef.ac.uk     1
```

```qw``` - Job has been submitted and is waiting in the queue.

```Eqw``` - Job has been submitted but an error is preventing job from starting.

```r``` - Job is currently running.

```qdel <job ID>``` will kill the job
